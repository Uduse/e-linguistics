I can read the owl files now. I took a look at the contents of the cope directory. Here are my comments:

What's the origin of  features.xls?


Issues for modeling phon. features using OWL-DL:


-decide what an IPA symbol is supposed to represent in the ontology. I believe we've been assuming 'Sound'. So then, we'd have:

Grapheme represents Sound

A subclass of Sound would be Vowel, Consontant, etc and perahps specific to the particular theory (ie COPE).

-define classes of sounds in terms of the features they take. We'll probably end up with similar looking hierarchies for sounds and features. Eg.,

Sonorant implies Voiced and not Stop [made up example here]

-or, we structure sound hierarchy, but keep feature hierarchy relatively flat


-deal w issue of underspec., namely that a sound can have a voicing feature, but not be specified as to plus or minus.

 
those are my random thoughts for now
