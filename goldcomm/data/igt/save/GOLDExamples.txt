Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca (1994:245-246),Caughley (1982)
In Chepang, a simple Future may be expressed by suffixing /-caʔ/ to the main verb as in the first example. This affix may also be used to express epistemic possibility, hence the double gloss in that example. The second and third examples illustrate the use of the suffix /-kheʔ/, in combination with tense/aspect suffixes. Caughley characterizes the difference between these examples as follows: for the second 'the action as a completed unit is about to occur', and for the third the action 'is about to begin'. The fourth example illustrates another immediate future. Caughley refers to /-dhaŋ/ as the 'Near Future Marker'. It combines with the suffix /-caʔ/.

Bybee, et al divide past tense systems into those that refer to daily cycles and those that do not. Typically, languages with past tenses that refer to a daily cycle will have tense that specifies 'today' and all others will refer to spans of time prior to 'today' (Bybee, et al 1994:99, Dahl 1985:125; Comrie 1985:93). Cocama is such a language. The examples above illustrate its three-way system of remoteness distinctions in the past tense.

These examples illustrate a reportedly binary, future/non-future tense system. Interlinear glosses are constructed here based on Haiman's discussion of verb stem alternations and their structures. Haiman reports that in Hua, Non-future tense is indicated by the lack of an auxiliary. Future tense is expressed with a variety of auxiliaries. The first example illustrates the Simple Indicative Future. The second is a Non-future tense with Interrogative Mood.

Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca (1994:245-246),Caughley (1982)
In Chepang, a simple Future may be expressed by suffixing /-ca?/ to the main verb as in the first example. This affix may also be used to express epistemic possibility, hence the double gloss in that example.

Asa TOP field hoe mentally.able - DEC  
Asa is able (knows how) to hoe fields 

NecessityModality
gle 
Noonan (1994:280) in Fox and Hopper (1994) 
The necessitative passive is a passive in Irish Gaelic in which the preposition 'with' is used, and a semantic meaning of necessity is added.

#Voice

AbsolutiveAntiPassiveVoice

Active
fuv 
McIntosh (1984:109) 
In Nigerian Fulfulde, the active voice is associated with transitivity, when the action is performed by an agent (subject) on another participant (object), or with intransitivity.

AgentDeletionPassiveVoice
ute 
Givon (1988:419) in Shibatani (1988) 
The object of the active in Ute retains its old case-marking in the passive, the subject of the active cannot appear in the passive clause, and the passive tends to be semantically active.

Siewierska (1988:267) in Shibatani (1988)

AntiPassiveVoice
mam
Klaiman (1991:229) from England (1985:212) 
In Northern Mam, the transitive subject takes on properties typical of the basic object.  Since in an ergative language the same morphological behaviors accrue to transitive object (P) as to intransitive subject (A), one effect of antipassivization is to dissociate the transitive subject (A) from its usual case assignment, the ergative, and reassign it the absolutive.

DeponentMiddleVoice

DirectVoice
crk
Klaiman (1991:32) from Wolfart (1973:25) 
In Plains Cree, the direct voice signals that the action proceeds in an ontologically salient way, i.e. that salience is assigned to nominals based on their referen'ts relative real-world capacities to control situations.
ni-sekih-a-nan  atim    
1-scare-theme.DIRECT-1PL  dog  
We scare the dog.

FocusAntiPassiveVoice
kek
Klaiman (1991:236) from Berinstein (1985:236) 
In Q'eqchi', the focus antipassive locks the P or logical object (basic absolutive) nominal from being assigned Focus salience.  Topic salience is available for assignment to various arguments, including the P, but Focus salience is always assigned to A, and is therefore inaccessible to P or any other nominal.

ImpersonalPassiveVoice
deu 
Klaiman (1991:7) 
In Standard German, the impersonal passive is a passive that alters the mapping of a nominal to the Subject relation in a basic intransitive structure.
es      wird     (von   den     Kindern)        geschlafen      
it  is  by  the  children.DAT  slept  
It is slept by the children.

IncorporatingAntiPassiveVoice
kek 
Klaiman (1991:232) from Berinstein (1985:219) 
In Q'eqchi',  the incorporating antipassive locks the P or logical object (basic absolutive) nominal from being assigned Focus salience. This correlates with the P's morphosyntactic downgrading, whereby it becomes insusceptible to any informational salience assignment.
x-e'-sic'-o-c   cape    li      cui_nk

Since in an ergative language the same morphological behaviors accrue to transitive object (P) as to intransitive subject (A), one effect of antipassivization is to dissociate the transitive subject (A) from its usual case assignment, the ergative, and reassign it the absolutive.

ContinuativeAspect

Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994:161)
However, an iterative gram may also apply to a predicate that describes a situation with multiple cycles, such as walking or swinging, and in such a case it closely resembles what we have called continuative meaning, that is, the sense of 'keep on doing'.

He kept on walking.

The original sense of this construction was one of destiny or obligation. It has long been used for future prediction in Spanish, but now, especially with the development of the future form 'go' (ir a), the model uses of the synthetic future are more common than the simple prediction uses in most dialects.

But while -caʔ by itself indicates future, it is not -kheʔ alone that marks immediate future, but rather -kheʔ in conjunction with one or the other of two tense/aspect suffixes: -ʔa, which Caughley labels the Past (cf.[7]), in which, as Caughley notes, it is properly functioning as a perfective), or -naʔ, the Non-past or general imperfective (8). Caughley characterizes the difference in meaning in the following way: for (7), "the action as a completed unit is about to occur"; for (8), [the action] "is about to begin."

Agent 
dak 
Foster (1979:499-500) from Frawley (1992:204) 
In Dakota, the agent is the deliberate, potent, active instigator of the predicate: the primary involved doer.  Normally the agent is human, and agency is therefore often connected with volition, will, intentionality, and responsibility.

Author
scs
Delancey (1984) from Frawley (1992:207) 
In North Slavey, the author is when the primary executor of an act has all the characteristics of an agent, but is not the direct cause of the act, the argument is the author.  The distinction between agent and author is made to accommodate differences in participation between those arguments that carry out acts for reasons internal to the arguments (agents) and those that carry out acts for noninternal reasons.  Semantically authors fall on a gradient between agents and instruments.

Liquor killed him/her/She/he died from liquor.

Instrument 
niu 
Seiter (1979:28-38) from Frawley (1992:209) 
In Niue, if an argument is the means by which a predicate is carried out, it has the thematic role instrument.  Unlike agents and authors, instruments must be acted on by something else in order to participate in the situation; their energy source is external to them.
ko      e       tohitohi        a       au      aki     e       titipi  
Pres  Erg  write  Abs  I  Instr  Abs  knife  
I'm writing with a knife ('carving').

Patient 
tgl 
Frawley (1992:212) 
In Tagalog, if an argument undergoes, is changed by, or is directly affected by a predicate, it is a patient.  This choice of terminology reflects the fact that a patient suffers the situation, or comes out changed as a result of the action of the predicate. The patient is the primary recipient of the event.

Experiencer 
kan
Hermon (1984:200-9) from Frawley (1992:215) 
In Kannada, if a predicate affects the internal state or constitution of an argument, then the argument has the thematic role experiencer. Because internally affected entities have to have an internal state to register the effect, experiencers frequently turn out to be human, or at least animate.  But because what counts as an internal state is fuzzy and may be construed differently by a culture or domain of discourse, experiencers are not necessarily animate.

Benefactive 
niu
Seiter (1979:32) from Frawley (1992:217) 
In Niue, the benefactive is used for a recipient that derives actions or entities from the actions of another.  Benefactives typically require an agent elsewhere in the predication.
Gahua   a       au      ma      e       tagata  k?

I work for that man.

Theme 
cho 
Broadwell (1988:124) from Frawley (1992:219) 
In Choctaw, a theme is used in the prototypical situation of motion, some entity is displaced as the result of an initiators influence and moves from some resting point along a trajectory, often to another resting point.  The displaced entity is the theme of the predication of displacement.

Source 
kal 
Fortescue (1984:214) from Frawley (1992:220)

Lynch (1982:41) from Frawley (1992:226) 
In Southwest Tanna, the reason role is the argument that denotes the prior conditions of a predication. Reasons are connected to the intentions of the agent and as such rely on prior events themselves for their existence.  Reasons may thus be said to link other events to a predication by means of the motivation of an agent.
