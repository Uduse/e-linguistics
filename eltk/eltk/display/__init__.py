Once the data are migrated to an interoperable RDF format, various display structures (dictionaries, interlinear glossed text, tabular paradigms) are then needed for rendering. For instance, it is of little use to display raw RDF code as the result of a data search. Instead we opt for display formats such as formatted HTML, PDF, etc.
