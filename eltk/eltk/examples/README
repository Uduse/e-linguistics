Overview
--------
This directory (eltk/examples/) contains a number of example scripts that illustrate how to use the ELTK. We focus on using the ELTK with Jpype and OWLAPI.

ELTK examples:
-------------
-import_ontology.py: shows how to import an OWL ontology's logical model (classes, individuals, properties) into the Python's OOP environment
-build_ontology.py: shows how to create an empty ontology and add a class 
-convert_bibtex.py: shows how to convert a bibtex file into RDF
-convert_character.py: illustrates a few conversions between character systems


---------
Important: 
---------- 
These Python files typically have to be run with the "python" command,
e.g. "python build_ontology.py" instead of "./build_ontology.py"
because of the lack of a specific Python declaration in each .py file.
