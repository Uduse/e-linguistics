Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca (1994:245-246) FROM Caughley (1982)
This Chepang example illustrates the use of the suffix /-kheʔ/, in combination with tense/aspect suffixes. Caughley says that the action as a completed unit is about to occur, which contrasts with a simple tense, i.e., with no information as to when the event might occur. The tense here should be read as 'immediate non-past tense'.
kim-	taŋ 	dah-	kheʔ-	naʔ
house-	ALL arrive- IMM-	NPST
He is about to arrive at the house

Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca (1994:245-246) FROM Caughley (1982)
In Chepang, a simple Future may be expressed by suffixing /-ceʔ/ to the main verb.
ŋa-	ʔi 	goʔ-	ceʔ-	na-	ŋ
1.SG-	AGR 	call-	FUT-	2-	1.EXCL
I will/may call you

Mugane (1997)
The affix kũ- in the first example may be used to mark either Hodiernal Past or Hodiernal Future depending on what aspect markers co-occur with it in the verb.
Kamau 	a-	kũ-	nyu-	a 	ũcũrũ
Kamau 	2.SG-	HOD.FUT-	drink 		14.porridge
Kamau will drink porridge (within the day)
 

HodiernalPastTense
cod
Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca (1994:98-99) FROM Faust (1978)
Bybee, et al divide past tense systems into those that refer to daily cycles and those that do not. Typically, languages with past tenses that refer to a daily cycle will have tense that specifies 'today' and all others will refer to spans of time prior to 'today' (Bybee, et al 1994:99, Dahl 1985:125; Comrie 1985:93). Cocama is such a language. The examples above illustrate its three-way system of remoteness distinctions in the past tense.
Ritama -	ca 	tuts -	ui
town-	to 	go-	HOD.PST
I went to town today.



ImmediateFutureTense
cdm
Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca (1994:245-246) FROM Caughley (1982)
This Chepang example illustrates the use of the suffix /dhaŋ-/, in combination with tense/aspect suffixes. With the immediate future, Caughley says that the action 'is about to begin'. 
ŋa-	ʔi-	dhaŋ 	yo-	dhaŋ-	ca-	ŋʔ
1.SG-	AGR-	IMM.FUT look-	IMM.FUT-FUT-	1.EXCL
I am about to look/I will look now.



ImmediatePastTense
cdm
Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994:246)
It is not -kheʔ alone that marks immediate past, but rather -kheʔ in conjunction with one or the other of two tense/aspect suffixes.
jaʔ-ʔi mak-kheʔ-ʔa-thəy
tiger-A devour-IMM-PST-GOAL
A tiger is about to devour him.

Haiman (1980:47, 140-1)
These examples illustrate a reportedly binary, future/non-future tense system. Interlinear glosses are constructed here based on Haiman's discussion of verb stem alternations and their structures. Haiman reports that in Hua, Non-future tense is indicated by the lack of an auxiliary. Future tense is expressed with a variety of auxiliaries. The first example illustrates the Simple Indicative Future.
hu -	gu -	e
do-	do-	FUT-	IND.SG

Haiman reports that in Hua, Non-future tense is indicated by the lack of an auxiliary. Future tense is expressed with a variety of auxiliaries. This example is a Non-future tense with Interrogative Mood.
hu -	ve

NonPastTense

Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994:246)
Caughley notes that -naʔ in the example is properly functioning as the non-past.
kim-taŋ dah-kheʔ-naʔ
house-ALL arrive-IMM-NPST
He is about to arrive at the house.

Comrie (1985:77)
In this Maltese example of the past perfect, the tense of the auxiliary 'to be' locates a a past or future reference point relative to which the main verb occurs.

He had been killing.

PreHodiernalPastTense locates the situation in question before that of a contrasting HodiernalPastTense. This category must be defined relative to a HodiernalPastTense 
Ritama -ca tutsu -icuá

Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca (1994:99) FROM Fortescue (1984:273)
Bybee, et al indicate that Inuktituk manifests a 2-way past distinction that makes no reference to daily cycles. The two subdivisions they reference are given in the second and third examples. The first example, with the affix glossed as PERF, illustrates a past that Fortescue claims is often understood as a general experiential past without any specified time. This might be analyzed as a Simple Past.

Mugane (1997)
The affix kũ- in the first example may be used to mark either Hodiernal Past or Hodiernal Future depending on what aspect markers co-occur with it in the verb. Also, in the examples above, the final vowel of each verb is phonological, hence there is no correspondent for it in the interlinear gloss.
Kamau 	a-	rĩĩ-	nyu-	a 	ũcũrũ

Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca (1994:103) FROM Fortescue (1984:272-3)
This Inuktitut example, the suffix meaning 'long ago' is make up of 'riir' meaning 'already' and the verb 'katag' meaning 'be bored with -ing'. 
tuqu -	riikatap -	puq
die-	REM.PST-	3.SG.IND

Comrie (1985:103)
In Bahinemo, the neutralised tense verb forms in question have overtly the form of the present, as in the following example, where the first verb is in the remote past tense, all following verbs in the present.
Nem na ya-tagiya-m, du-qi-yasinu, de-tenowa-u, niba la-hina-fanel, idu du-wei

Palmer (2001:5) FROM Klein (1975)
The  example from Spanish, illustrating Indicative mood, may be compared with that of Subjunctive mood. Subjunctive is used to express doubt about a proposition.
Creo 	que 	aprende

I believe that he is learning.



OptativeMood, ProhibitiveMood

I doubt that he is learning.




SubjunctiveMood, TimitiveMood

Palmer (2001:133)
Palmer notes that the Timitive Mood tends to be expressed with a verb of fearing plus a subjunctive verb in a subordinate clause.
Timeo ne 	laborem 	agueam
I fear 	work 	increase-	1.SG.PRS.SBJV
I am afraid that I shall increase my work

SubjunctiveMood

Givon (1984:303-319)
The jussive, or subjunctive, mode is found in complements of epistemic and manipulative verbs.
espero que  no  venga
hope-I that NEG come-SBJV
I hope that he won't come.




IrrealisMood

Palmer (2001:5) FROM Roberts (1990)
Irrealis mood is an epistemic modality that indicates possible or conditional truth.

Palmer (2001:5) FROM Roberts (1990)
Realis encodes that the speaker is offering and unqualified statement of fact. The term 'realis' is synonymous with the term 'indicative' and therefore 'declarative.'

ActiveVoice
fuv 
McIntosh (1984:109) 
In Nigerian Fulfulde, the active voice is associated with transitivity, when the action is performed by an agent (subject) on another participant (object), or with intransitivity.

1-load-ACT-2 
I put a head-load on you.



AgentDeletionPassiveVoice
ute 
Givon (1988:419) in Shibatani (1988)

Siewierska (1988:267) in Shibatani (1988)

AntiPassiveVoice
mam
Klaiman (1991:229) FROM England (1985:212) 
In Northern Mam, the transitive subject takes on properties typical of the basic object.  Since in an ergative language the same morphological behaviors accrue to transitive object (P) as to intransitive subject (A), one effect of antipassivization is to dissociate the transitive subject (A) from its usual case assignment, the ergative, and reassign it the absolutive. (RN=relational noun)

DirectVoice
crk
Klaiman (1991:32) FROM Wolfart (1973:25) 
In Plains Cree, the direct voice signals that the action proceeds in an ontologically salient way, i.e. that salience is assigned to nominals based on their referen'ts relative real-world capacities to control situations.

FocusAntipassiveVoice
kek
Klaiman (1991:236) FROM Berinstein (1985:236) 
In Q'eqchi', the focus antipassive locks the P or logical object (basic absolutive) nominal from being assigned Focus salience.  Topic salience is available for assignment to various arguments, including the P, but Focus salience is always assigned to A, and is therefore inaccessible to P or any other nominal.

kek 
Klaiman (1991:232) FROM Berinstein (1985:219) 
In Q'eqchi',  the incorporating antipassive locks the P or logical object (basic absolutive) nominal from being assigned Focus salience. This correlates with the P's morphosyntactic downgrading, whereby it becomes insusceptible to any informational salience assignment.
